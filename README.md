# ⚙️ Arduino DC Motor Control with LCD

## 🧠 Project Overview
I worked on controlling two DC motors using an L293D motor driver and an Arduino UNO.  
The system performs the following movements:
1. Forward for 30 seconds  
2. Backward for 60 seconds  
3. Alternates right and left for 1 minute  

An LCD screen displays the current movement during operation.
